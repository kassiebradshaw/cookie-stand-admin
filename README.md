## Overview

React is great! And though it does A LOT, it's not a full framework. In other words, many common tasks are not handled out of the box by React. So it's up to us devs to make some decisions about how to use React in combination with other tools.

One greate "stack" is to use Next.js (which builds on top of React) and style with Tailwind.

Your job is to create a Cookie Stand Admin app using Next.js and style using Tailwind CSS
